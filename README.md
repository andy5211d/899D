Standig 899D Combo_Hot_Air_Soldering_Station

Here is a mostly complete schematic and PCB pics of my 899D combo hot air & soldering station. 
Note, the schematic is a modified copy of the schematic from acbaruth/898D repository.  I have
not checked very componet to see it correct but the PCBs are very simmular but not identical.

Also Note, the Standig unit uses a 6 pin soldering iron connector.   

TO DO:   Upload schematic and pictures!!
